Introduction
============
This is the smc-python library to interface with the Forcepoint NGFW Management Center.

This acts as an front-end to simplify interactions and simplify scripting when looking
to integrate automated functionality. 

The smc-python library also has a CLI that provides a command completion syntax to provide
guidance on commands to be run, and can be run remotely from the Forcepoint NGFW Engines. All
actions interact with the Security Management Center (SMC), and commands specific to the NGFW
Engines are proxied by the Management Server component of the SMC to the individual deviecs. 

Current versions are validated using:

* Forcepoint NGFW Management Center 5.10, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 (Windows/Linux)
* Python 2.7.x,
* Python 3.4, Python 3.5, Python 3.6 (version >= 0.4)
